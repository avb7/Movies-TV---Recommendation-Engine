### ◎ THE AMAZON MOVIES & TV DATASET

### Context

```
Amazon is an eCommerce platform that
sells a wide range of products to its
users. There are various types of
products, therefore being able to suggest
users the products they are interested in
is crucial to their business. A
recommender system allows showcasing
the “right” products to the user, i.e.
recommending the customers the
products they are most likely to
purchase. Building a recommender
system involves exploring the data
collected on user activity, and applying
suitable techniques to predict whether a
user will purchase a product or not.
We aim to study Amazon’s ‘Movies & TV’
category of products, and will predict
whether the user will purchase a given
product or not.
